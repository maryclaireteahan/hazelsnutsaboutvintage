## CODE VALIDATION

<details>

### HTML

The [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all HTML files.
In order to properly validate the HTML pages with Jinja syntax, the steps are followed for each file:

- Navigate to the deployed application using Google Chrome,
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select View Page Source.
- Copy the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax., and use the validate by input method.

The result for each page are listed bellow:

|Page |Screenshot | Notes  |
